{"prompt":"What should be the Land to Asset ratio of investment property for the long term growth ?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" As a general rule of thumb, if the property is at least 15 years old and on a 500sqm+ then it meets our threshold.###"}
{"prompt":"Is it good to buy a property in solely under one person's name or joint ?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Generally, your borrowing power multiplies when property is bought in a joint name (assuming all borrowers are in good financial standing).###"}
{"prompt":"Advantage of buying a property in solo rather than Joint ?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If it is a negatively geared property (after accounting for depreciation) you may want to consider buying solely in the name of the person who is paying the most tax from their income.###"}
{"prompt":"Advantage of buying a property in Joint rather than Solo ?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" there are some land tax disadvantages in buying in joint names. For example in NSW land tax is based on per entity, so if husband + wife then you get one threshold and you will reach that threshold quicker and start paying tax tax quicker. But if you buy separately it's two times the threshold. QLD doesn't matter as it's split between the two. Please check with the accountant the exact policy state by state. If it's a property you are buying with an express intention of selling in the future, then you may want to consider buying in joint names, to minimise the capital gains tax in the future.###"}
{"prompt":"What should be the minimum bedroom sizes for property ?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Ideally the bedrooms sizes should be 3meters x 2.7meters minimum. However you may make a trade off if you are getting a really good deal. ###"}
{"prompt":"What should I do if property has an toilet, rumpus etc that is not council approved. ?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It's quite common for properties to have unapproved alterations. Normally if there are alterations to the property, they should have been done legally. You may be able to seek retrospective approval for them. Bear in mind that this costs time and money. These things can also be common for an area (check with your PM) in which case it is not as big of a risk (as long as you don’t plan to structurally change the house in the future). ###"}
{"prompt":"What should be the gross rental yield for investment prompt ?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Yield of 4-4.50%+ will make the property as neutral which means the rental income would be sufficient to maintain the property. Rental yield below 4-4.5% will leave the property with negatively geared which means you will need to take money from your own pocket to maintain the property. Again this depends on interest rate too.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the difference between the typical value (TV) and median 12 months?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The TV aims to represent the typical value of properties in a suburb (houses/units). It is based on recentsales data. The median 12 months is the median sale figure from all sales that occurred in the last year. Because it covers a longer period of time, it has a much smoother curve on the historical chart. However, it may be wellbehind the 8-ball in fast-moving markets. We should use the typical value because it is the most accurate up to date estimate for property values. It can be used to find suburbs with the most chance of having property suiting an investor's budget.###"}
{"prompt":"How do I determine whether a Suburb has a developable land supply?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" On Google satellite view check if there is vacant land around the Suburb. You need to make sure whether it is developable, by calling the council. Calling the council, perhaps even a couple different times on different days to speak with the town planner/duty manager will allow you to understand their forecast for the developable land. Calling a couple times can help you get the perspective of two different people from the council on two different days.###"}
{"prompt":"Should I consider the crime rate in a Suburb?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Crime is not something that has a major effect on capital growth. Lots of places in all states and territories that still rise in value, and slowly gentrify. Main thing is to follow intra suburb factors.###"}
{"prompt":"How do we analyse Suburbs that have little to no job or accessibility infrastructure going on?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" We are very flexible when it comes to infrastructure as explained in the Course. Infrastructure alone does not increase prices. So it's nice to have.###"}
{"prompt":"Can we consider properties that are very close to the flood zone?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It's fine to buy properties that are close to a flood zone, as long as the property itself is not in the flood zone. Generally, flood overlay is in blue shading on most cities' mapping systems.. so if the property has the shading over it, it's best to avoid.###"}
