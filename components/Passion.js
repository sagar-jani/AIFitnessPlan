      <h2 className="text-2xl font-medium text-center">My Passion for Fitness</h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed my-5">
        My passion for fitness began a decade ago and has only continued to grow stronger over the years. I have always believed that staying active and healthy is essential for living a fulfilling and happy life. I have dedicated myself to learning all I can about fitness, including the latest training techniques and nutritional guidelines.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed my-5">
        As a result of my passion and dedication, I have been able to maintain a fit and healthy lifestyle for many years now. I typically train for 4-5 days a week, focusing on a mix of strength training and cardio. I believe that a well-rounded fitness routine is key to achieving overall health and wellness. I also keep my training simple, focusing on exercises that are efficient and effective, rather than trying to do too much at once.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed my-5">
        In addition to my regular training, I also pay close attention to my nutrition. I believe that what we eat is just as important as how we exercise. I keep my diet simple and focus on eating whole, unprocessed foods. I aim to consume a balanced mix of protein, carbohydrates and healthy fats, which help me to maintain energy levels throughout the day.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed my-5">
        Overall, my passion for fitness has been a driving force in my life for many years. I believe that with the right mindset and dedication, anyone can achieve their fitness goals. I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and experience with others who are also looking to improve their health and well-being.
